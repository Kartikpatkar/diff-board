# 🔒 Privacy Policy – DiffBoard

*Last updated: December 2025*

**DiffBoard** is designed with **developer privacy, transparency, and offline-first principles** at its core.
We strongly believe that **your code and data should always stay with you**.

---

## 🛡️ What This Extension Does

**DiffBoard** helps developers to:

* Compare code, text, and JSON side-by-side
* Visualize differences using GitHub-style diffs
* Format and compare JSON payloads
* Copy full diffs or specific added/removed lines
* Switch between light and dark themes

All comparisons and processing happen **entirely within your browser**.

---

## 🔐 Data Collection

DiffBoard **does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal data**.

Specifically:

* ❌ No analytics or tracking
* ❌ No cookies
* ❌ No user profiling
* ❌ No external API calls
* ❌ No network requests for your content

Your code, text, and JSON **never leave your device**.

---

## 💾 Local Storage Usage

DiffBoard may use Chrome’s **local storage** only for **non-sensitive preferences**, such as:

* Theme preference (light / dark mode)
* UI state (last active tab or view)
* Optional editor state (if enabled in future)

This data:

* Is stored **locally** in your browser
* Is **never synced to external servers**
* Can be cleared anytime via browser settings

---

## 🧱 Offline & Remote Code Policy

DiffBoard:

* ✅ Works fully offline
* ❌ Does not load remote scripts
* ❌ Does not execute third-party code from the internet

All HTML, CSS, JavaScript, icons, and libraries (jsdiff, Diff2Html, Monaco, etc.) are:

* Bundled with the extension
* Executed locally
* Fully auditable

This ensures maximum security and transparency.

---

## 🔑 Permissions Explanation

DiffBoard requests only minimal permissions required for functionality:

* **`storage`**
  Used to save theme and UI preferences locally.

* **`contextMenus`** *(optional / future use)*
  Intended for future features like “Compare selected text”.

No permission is used to read browsing history or access external data.
